**Basic_start** uses the MATLAB Arduino support package, real-time pacer, and is compatible with MATLAB 2014a+

**Model_test** is similar to **Basic_start** but also includes a linear and nonlinear model that are computed in parallel to the TCLab measurements.

**Simplified** uses the newer Simulink Arduino support package but is only compatible with MATLAB 2018a+.
