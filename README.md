Process Control Temperature Lab

This lab reinforces principles of system dynamics, 
estimation, and model predictive control, including:

-The difference between manual and automatic control

-Step tests to generate dynamic data for empirical modeling

-Dynamic modeling with first principles

-Dynamic data reconciliation

-Tune a moving horizon estimator

-Tune a PID controller

-Tune a model predictive controller

-Combine MHE and MPC
