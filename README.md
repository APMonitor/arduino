Process Control Temperature Lab

See: http://apmonitor.com/do/index.php/Main/ArduinoLab for MATLAB version of lab
See: http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl for Python version of the lab

Students have an opportunity to use this lab to learn principles of system dynamics, 
estimation, and model predictive control. In particular, this lab reinforces: 

-The difference between manual and automatic control 
-Step tests to generate dynamic data for empirical modeling 
-Dynamic modeling with first principles 
-Dynamic data reconciliation 
-Tune a moving horizon estimator 
-Tune a model predictive controller 
-Combine MHE and MPC
